UI clones for personal project - FletNix
Problem statement 
 Kartik is really confused about what to watch on Netflix, he has pretty basic
subscription of the app in which he is not able to search for any movie/tv series and also not able
to filter out genre. You must build an app named FletNix which has all the textual data about shows
available on Netflix, your app should be able to search and filter through the list of tvshows/movies.
Kartik is really looking forward to solving his confusion through your app.
